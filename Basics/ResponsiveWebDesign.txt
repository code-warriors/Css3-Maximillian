--------------------Media Query -----------------------------
Read the Media query as If, else statement.
max-width:  atmost          ----  Desktop first approach
min-width: atleast          ----  Mobile first approach

majorily width of mobile-screen are in between 300px - 700px
min-width : 40rem comes first in writing order then the min-width:60rem

add all media Query below the all codes


multiple media query can be used. 
multiple media query conditions can be used using "And".
        @media(min-width:20rem and oreintation: landscape) //Both need to be true.
2. "," seperated this is working like OR operator
        @media(min-width:20rem, oreintation: landscape)  //either one of them need to be true


avoid using oreintation: landscape/potrait but instead of 
min-width and min-height combination 

------------------------------- FLEX BOX ---------------------------------------

display: flex;
default of flex-direction is left to right.
Two axis are there main-axis and cross-axis.
flex-direction used to decide the main-axis direction weather horizontal and vertical.
Properties of flex-cotainer:

   1.   align-items:center, flex-start, flex-end.

        align-items used for the direction of cross axis.

   2.   justify-content: affects our main-axis.
   3.   align-content: allow us to align our items along the cross-axis. this comes 
                       into play when we have second row to display means squeezing the 
                       browser screen.
   4.   Unordered List(ul) can also be flexed.
   5.   Flex-flow : the direction of main-axis by default Left to right.

Properties of Flex-items

    1.  Order property defines the order in which the current item is occurring.
        at position first, second, third, fourth etc. Default value is 0.
        highest position or order value occurred at last and item with lowest order value
        comming at starting.
    2.  Align-self property positioned the specific element according to the cross-axis.
        align-self: flex-start / flex-end.
    3.  Flex-grow : Default value is 0.
        Defines the growing width of div items....as the flex-grow defines the remaining width 
        of the browser propprtioned to the flex-grow items.
        .item-1 => flex-grow : 1     .item-2 => flex-grow : 4 
        remaining width divide into 5 parts, 
        .item-1 gets (1/5)th part of it. and
        .item-2 gets (4/5)th part of it.
        when wrap to next row it will take up the entire width of browser.
    4.  Flex-shrink : default value is 1.
        If flex-shrink have value 0 then it will not shrink then its own defined width.
        otherwise it behave in opposite way to flex-grow.
        if you add a flex shrink value which is different from zero,it first allows us to 
        allow our elements to shrink but if we apply a bigger shrink value to different 
        elements, then this will also define how much more one element is allowed to 
        shrink when comparing it to another element and that's actually what we 
        can do with flex shrink.
    5. Flex-basis : affects the width if the flex-direction goes from left to right, 
                    affects the height if the flex-direction goes from top to bottom.
                    So flex basis is not the width or the height,it can basically be 
                    both which is simply dependent on the flex direction.So the flex basis will 
                    fallback to the default value set for the main axis and that's important. If the 
                    main axis goes from left to right, this will be the width right here, if the 
                    main axis goes from top to bottom, then this will be the height.
                    "auto" value means the fallback value i,e the value i,e already defined into it.
    6. flex : 0(grow) 1 (shrink) auto (basis)

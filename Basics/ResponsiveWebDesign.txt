--------------------Media Query -----------------------------
Read the Media query as If, else statement.
max-width:  atmost          ----  Desktop first approach
min-width: atleast          ----  Mobile first approach

majorily width of mobile-screen are in between 300px - 700px
min-width : 40rem comes first in writing order then the min-width:60rem

add all media Query below the all codes


multiple media query can be used. 
multiple media query conditions can be used using "And".
        @media(min-width:20rem and oreintation: landscape) //Both need to be true.
2. "," seperated this is working like OR operator
        @media(min-width:20rem, oreintation: landscape)  //either one of them need to be true


avoid using oreintation: landscape/potrait but instead of 
min-width and min-height combination
